<p>
  I'm a web developer from Argentina. 🇦🇷
  
  💻 My journey in the coding realm has been marked by a focus on PHP, particularly within the Laravel framework. I also worked with Slim and on some occasions with pure PHP. 
  
  🚀 On the front-end, I wield the power of Angular as my primary framework, crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I've also navigated the realms of React. Currently exploring the world of Vue.js.
  
  🌐 Let's connect and build something amazing together! Feel free to explore my repositories and drop a message if you have any exciting projects or ideas to discuss.

  Happy coding! 🚀✨
