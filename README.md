<p>
  I'm a web developer from Argentina. 🇦🇷
  
  💻 I like PHP, and particularly Laravel. I also worked with Slim and on some occasions with pure PHP.
  
  🚀 On the front-end, I use Angular as my main framework, crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I also like React. Currently exploring the world of Vue.
  
  🌐 Let's connect and build something amazing together! Feel free to explore my repositories and drop a message if you have any exciting projects or ideas to discuss.

  Happy coding! 🚀✨
